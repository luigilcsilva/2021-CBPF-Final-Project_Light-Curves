# Final-Project_Light-Curves
This is the final project for the CBPF course Métodos para Análise de grande volume de dados e Astroinformática. The goal of the project presented here is to show some ideas on how to classify variable brightness astronomical objects from their light curves. The main idea was to use a Machine Learning model, the Random Forest model, to this attempt of classification.
